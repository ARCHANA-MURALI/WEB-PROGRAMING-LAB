<p><i><h3 style="color:#6F124d;text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;"> Although it is a Hindu festival, it is popular among non-Hindus. People gather the
 night before Holi and perform religious rituals and then pray for the destruction of their internal evil. 
The next morning people start the real carnival traditions and smear each other with colored powders; they 
sometimes use water guns and water-filled balloons for more fun. Groups of people march the streets with drums
 and other instruments, singing and dancing. People also gather with their families and friends to color each
 other and share Holi delicacies.
