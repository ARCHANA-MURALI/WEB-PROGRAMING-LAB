<p><i><h3 style="color:#FF7D-59;text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;">fruit, the fleshy or dry ripened ovary of a flowering plant, enclosing 
the seed or seeds. Thus, apricots, bananas, and grapes, as well as bean pods, corn grains, tomatoes, cucumbers,
 and (in their shells) acorns and almonds, are all technically fruits. Popularly, however, the term is 
restricted to the ripened ovaries that are sweet and either succulent or pulpy. For treatment of the 
cultivation of fruits, see fruit farming. For treatment of the nutrient composition and processing of fruits,
 see fruit processing.
