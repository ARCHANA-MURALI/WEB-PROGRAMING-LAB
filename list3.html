<p><i><h3 style="color:#FF7D-59;text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;">flower, Reproductive portion of any flowering plant
 (angiosperm). Popularly, the term applies especially when part or all of the
 reproductive structure is distinctive in colour and form. Flowers present a 
multitude of combinations of colour, size, form, and anatomical arrangement. 
In some plants, individual flowers are very small and are borne in a distinctive
 cluster (inflorescence).
