<p><i><h3 style="color:#FF7D-59;text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;">Vegetable, the edible product
 of a herbaceous plant-that is, a plant with a soft stem, as distinguished from
 the edible nuts and fruits produced by plants with woody stems such as shrubs 
and trees. Vegetables can be grouped according to the edible part of each plant: 
leaves (lettuce), stalks (celery), roots (carrot), tubers (potato), bulbs (onion)
, and flowers (broccoli). In addition, fruits such as the tomato and seeds such 
as the pea are commonly considered vegetables.
Fruit, mature ovary in flowering plants, together with all inseparably connected
 parts of the flower. In strict botanical usage, the meaning may be restricted 
to the ovary alone. Commonly the term fruit is often restricted to succulent, 
edible fruits of woody plants, to melons, and to such small fruits as 
strawberries and blueberries. In nature, fruit is normally produced only after 
fertilization of ovules has taken place, but in many plants, largely cultivated
 varieties such as seedless citrus fruits, bananas, and cucumbers, fruit matures
 without fertilization, a process known as parthenocarpy
