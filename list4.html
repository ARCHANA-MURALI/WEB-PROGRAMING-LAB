Tree, woody plant that regularly renews its growth (perennial). Most plants 
classified as trees have a single self-supporting trunk containing woody tissues,
 and in most species the trunk produces secondary limbs, called branches. 
can live for a very long time. It has a single stem or trunk and branches that 
support leaves. Beneath the ground, a tree has a root system that acts as an 
anchor and stores the water and nutrients the plant needs to grow.
